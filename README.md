# Project_3

## Objective:
This project works with the ETL data from Project 2, wherein multiple sources of online movie ratings and box office revenue by film and distributor are compared. The dataframe is loaded into a Flask app, an HTML and CSS front end is built, and the analytic reports are visualized with Javascript and plotly.js. The app is then deployed to the web via Heroku for portfolio presentation.
